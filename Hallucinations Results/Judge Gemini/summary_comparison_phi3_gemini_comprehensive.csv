"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ for double vision. On arrival, he had a CT scan that revealed no signs of an acute intracranial process. An MRI/MRA was completed for further evaluation of ischemia. However, there were no findings on MRI c/w acute infarct. We consulted ophthamology and they suspect that his vision loss was secondary to an ischemic event despite no radiologic findings. We increased his aspirin from 81mg to 325mg daily during his hospitalization. We prescribed artificial tears four times a day per ophthamology recommendations. He was referred to neuro-ophthamology as an outpatient. He was also scheduled for an ECHO as an outpatient within the next ___ hours. During his hospitalization, he was started on an insulin sliding scale. He did have one episode of hypoglycemia to 38. However, he was given dextrose. The insulin sliding scale was discontinued because the patient did not require insulin. He has no history of diabetes. His blood sugar measured in the 150s at the time of discharge. He was given a letter for his work. We recommended 1 week off while he recovers. We encouraged him to see Dr. ___ ___, within one week to re-evaluate his vision and determine whether he was fit to return to work.","You were admitted after you developed double vision. We suspect that you may have an ischemic event to one of the nerves supplying the muscles to the eye. During your hospitalization, you had a CT scan and an MRI completed that did not reveal any signs of an acute stroke. The ophthomalogist evaluated you during your hospital admission and they suspect that your symptoms may have developeed secondary to an ischemiv event. Although there are no radiologic images that reveal a large stroke, we are treating you as if you had an ischemic event. We made some modifications in your home medication. We increased your aspirin from 81mg to 325mg. Ophthomalogy recommended artificial tears 4 times a day to both eyes. Finally, you should continue your home dose of metoprolol and simvastatin. We planned to complete an ECHO as an inpatient, however, this study can be completed as an outpatient. We ordered an ECHO in the next ___ hours. You will be contacted directly with information about the time of your ECHO.","```json

Despite this relief, the ophthalmology team suspects that you might be experiencing ischemia in the eye—a sort of mini-stroke without lasting damage on MRI and contrast imaging typically used to spot strokes directly affecting brain tissue. To manage potential inflammation or other issues related to this suspicion, they increased your aspirin dosage for now as a preventative measure against any further ischemic events in the eyes while reducing possible allergens with artificial tears four times daily based on recommendations by eye specialists.

Your heart health was also monitored during stay since you were started to be managed under insulin therapy due to an episode of hypoglycemia, which we addressed promptly and safely without any permanent damage reported upon discharge with your blood sugar levels in the 150s range afterward. Thankfully, given that diabetes was not a history for you, this seems more like stress-induced due to illness rather than an ongoing issue but nonetheless is something we continue to be vigilant about as it can impact overall health and recovery times significantly in the future if recurrently encountered.

As per your discharge plan from hereon, a follow-up appointment with Dr. ___ __ (the ophthalmologist's name should go here), is highly recommended within one week to reassess your visual symptoms after hospitalization and ensure that it’s safe for you to return back home without the double vision impeding on daily activities, including work responsibilities where eye performance plays a crucial role.","['Double vision', 'Evaluation for intracranial process', 'Evaluation for ischemia']","['MRI/MRA completed with ophthalmology suspecting ischemic event', 'Aspirin increased from 81mg to 325mg daily', 'Episode of hypoglycemia and discontinuation of insulin sliding scale']",['Follow-up with Dr. ___ ___ within one week for vision re-evaluation'],3,3,1
"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ old right-handed male with a history of CAD, HTN, CHF, obesity, prior L cerebellar CVA, L3-L4 osteomyelitis and afib on warfarin and aspirin who had two distinct episodes of unresponsiveness and speech difficulty followed by disorientation and confusion concerning for seizure. . He was initially seen as a code stroke and was found to have no deficits on initial exam. However, when on the way to get his CT scan he had another episode of acute disorientation but was noted to be speaking fluently during this episode (unlike the one prior to admission). His CT did not show any acute stroke or hemorrhage, and his CTA was reassuring, with no changes from prior - cervical atherosclerosis and L vertebral artery occusion. . Given the nature of the episodes and the fact that Mr. ___ was more or less at his baseline in between, there is significant suspicion for seizure activity. He had no recollection of these episodes during this hospitalization and in fact, was quite adamant about returning home at one point because he was convinced that nothing was wrong. Mr. ___ has had EEGs in the past without epileptiform activity, but asymmetric slowing. He was started on Keppra 1500mg BID during this admission which he should continue. He had no further episodes while on Keppra during this admission. His MRI showed small area of restricted diffusion that appeared extra-axial and was thought to likely be artifact. He continued to have a nonfocal neuro exam during this admission. . Notably, his INR is subtherapeutic. Regarding his stroke risk factors - fasting lipid panel Chol 114, LDL 62, HBA1c borderline at 6.0, TSH 0.91. . He was continued on his home medications including aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, and warfarin. He was started on a ___ bridge 100mg BID until his INR was therapeutic. . It is unclear why he was on both full dose aspirin and coumadin as an outpatient - he stated that he was on this regimen per his cardiologist. His cardiologist was emailed regarding this. There was a discharge summary from ___ from prior admission that states that he was to stop taking aspirin once his coumadin was therapeutic. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Likely seizure, started Keppra - Follow up with neurology - Subtherapeutic INR - discharged on ___ bridge - Need for both aspirin and coumadin - Will likely need to stop aspirin. - No driving for 6 months, avoiding activities including climbing ladders, taking baths alone, or operating heavy machinery for several months until seizure free.","Mr. ___, You were admitted to the hospital with spells that are consistent with seizures. We think that your seizures may be a result from your old stroke and cumulative injury to the brain from hypertension. An MRI of your brain was obtained and it showed a small abnormality on your right brain that may be an artifact. EEG (brain wave study) showed some abnormalities. You were started on levetiracetam for your seizures. Please remember that you are required by ___ law to refrain from driving for 6 months after your last seizure. Please also avoid activities that may be dangerous for you to perform if you were alone - ie climbing ladders, taking baths alone, or operating heavy machinery - for the next several months in case you have more seizures.","```json

Subsequent EEGs have not shown definitive evidence of epileptiform discharge; however, asymmetric slowing was noted in the past which aligns with your episodes' characteristics when observed between hospital admissions - periods where you seemed at baseline and could recall events clearly or even insist on going home. While a small area suggestive of restricted diffusion raised some concern for seizure activity, it appeared to be an artifact according to MRI interpretation by our medical team. Your INR level was found to be subtherapeutic; hence we initiated treatment with Keppra 1500mg twice daily without further episodes occurring during your hospital stay on this regimen. Notably, a discrep0n in the management of aspirin and warfarin therapy exists as you were reportedly taking both outpatient; however, there is documentation to cease aspirin once therapeutic INR levels are reached with Coumadin alone - this will be clarified upon follow-up consultation.

"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male with a history of congential diaphragmatic hernia repair as an infant presented to ___ on ___ with acute onset of abdominal pain. CT A/P revealed a dilated right lower quadrant small bowel loop in a C-shaped configuration, raising the possibility for an internal hernia or closed loop obstruction without evidence of wall ischemia or perforation. The patient continued to pass some flatus and was non-toxic appearing with lactate trending down. The patient was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service for nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression, bowel rest and fluid resuscitation. On POD2, the patient did not demonstrate any clinical signs of improvement and was taken to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of duodenal bands, adhesions and internal hernia sacs as well as appendectomy, colopexy for malrotation and a small bowel resection with stapled anastomosis x 1. The patient tolerated these procedures well. An NGT was placed for bowel decompression. After remaining hemodynamically stable in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the surgical floor for pain control and return of bowel function. Once on the surgical floor, the patient was kept NPO with IV hydration and IV pain medicine for pain control. Once the patient began to pass flatus, the NGT was removed and the patient was started on a clears diet which was well-tolerated. On POD5, the patient was noted to have scrotal edema with pain and had an ultrasound which revealed epididymitis. The patient was started on a 10 day course of Levofloxacin. The patient was later advanced to a regular diet, however, he became nauseous and had emesis. The patient was made NPO and had imaging which showed a partial small bowel obstruction with gradual transition in the left mid abdomen. The patient had a NGT reinserted for bowel decompression. The patient had repeat abdominal x-rays over the course of the week which later demonstrated the passage of contrast through the colon. His NGT was clamped which had scant residual output. He was started on a clear liquid diet with the NGT in place which he tolerated well. The NGT was removed on ___ and he was started on a regular diet which was well-tolerated. His abdominal staples were removed and the wound edges were well-approximated. The patient was alert and oriented throughout hospitalization. Once tolerating a diet, the patient was written for oral acetaminophen and oxycodone for pain control. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization. The patient's intake and output were closely monitored The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs of bleeding, of which there were none. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating a diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient had his prescriptions for po zofran, oxycodone and Levofloxacin filled at the bedside prior to discharge and was instructed to take only two more doses of Levofloxacin. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.","You were admitted to the hospital with an intestinal obstruction. You were taken to the operating room an underwent lysis of abdominal adhesive scar tissue bands. You had a nasogastric tube placed to help with bowel decompression. You started having return of bowel function and this tube was removed, but you later became nauseated with vomiting and had the nasogastric tube replaced. The tube has been removed again and you are now tolerating a regular diet. While in the hospital, you were diagnosed with epididymitis, an infection of the duct behind the testis.

Psychiatric follow-up is critical as your depression/anxiety symptoms are significant; however, doxepin has been held at discharge time and should be reviewed with a mental health provider to ensure appropriate management of anxiety and insomnia given potential QTc prolongation interactions noted. There was also an indication of splenomegaly seen on ultrasound without apparent cause for the abdominal pain, further follow-up required in this aspect as well. Outpatient coordination with Oncology is essential to monitor and manage your multiple myeloma post-discharge along with a necessary transition plan involving EKG monitoring of QTc duration due to potential drug interactions that might affect the heart's electrical activity, specifically in relation to fluconazole treatment. Discharge paperwork for 45 minutes was spent ensuring all aspects were covered and coordinated care planned effectively with outpatient providers.","['Dyspnea', 'Abdominal pain', 'Elevated bilirubin']","['Diagnosis and initiation of fluconazole for Esophagitis', 'Investigation and improvement of Elevated Bilirubin']",['Ensure follow-up with Oncology'],3,2,1

"Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ year-old woman with Crohn's disease, hydraadenitis, and RA presenting with worsening RLQ pain for 1 week following colonscopy. ACTIVE DIAGNOSES ================ # Phlegmon: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease on Humira and developed severe RLQ abdominal pain with nausea 2 days following a routine surveillance colonoscopy. She was afebrile with normal vital signs through her course. She had tenderness in the RLQ. CT scan showed extensive inflammatory and phlegmonous changes in the right lower abdomen without evidence of a drainable abscess. The differential diagnosis included appendicitis/appendiceal rupture and Crohn's flare. She was treated conservatively, initially with IV Unasyn, pain management, and nothing by mouth. Her diet was advanced as tolerated to a regular diet; however, she did not tolerate a regular diet well as it caused increased abdominal pain. In consultation with the gastroenterology service, she was placed on liquid diet including Ensure and was advised to continue it for two weeks. Once tolerating liquids, she was transitioned to oral Augmentin for a total antibiotic course of 14 days (final dose on ___ and pain management with oral tramadol and acetaminophen. The Humira was held in the setting of infection, and should be restarted once the infection has resolved. # Hidradenitis: The patient has a history of hidradenitis and was found to have puruluent nodules with erythema in left axilla consistent with hidradentis and a superimposed cellulitis. She was initially treated with IV vancomycin with resolution of the purulent drainage and erythema. She was transitioned to oral Augmentin to treat both the hidradenitis and phlegmon, with a final dose on ___. She should follow-up with her primary care physician and dermatologist regarding long-term management of her hidradenitis. # Drug rash/eruption: Upon initiation of augmentin, developed sparse vesicular, nonerythematous, non pruritic lesions on her torso that were felt to be a drug eruption. As they were minimal and not bothersome, no change was made to her augmentin however explicit recommendations to request alternative agents (cipro/flagyl) were counselled if the rash worsened. CHRONIC DIAGNOSES ================= # Arthritis associated with IBD: The patient has a history of arthritis associated with IBD treated with Humira. The Humira was held in the setting of infection, and she should restart Humira once the infection has resolved. # Normocytic anemia: The patient has had a normocytic anemia since ___ as evidenced by Atrius records. The most likely cause is anemia of chronic inflammation in setting of Crohn's disease and arthritis associated with IBD. While a mild iron deficiency anemia can be normocytic, the suspicion for this is low given the chronicity of the anemia. Her anemia was followed with daily CBCs, and her anemia remained stable. Work-up of the anemia is left to the discretion of her primary care provider. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== # Augmentin: Continue Augmentin until ___. # MR enterography: She was scheduled to undergo MR enterography on ___ as a follow-up to her colonoscopy. Such a study would not be useful in the setting her the extenstive abdominal inflammation. The MR enterography should be scheduled for a time after the inflammation has resolved. # Hepatic lesion: 2 cm hepatic lesion with peripheral nodular enhancement noted on CT abdomen/pelvis, most likely representing hemangioma. It is stable from prior CT scans. Attention to this finding on MR. # ___: She should restart Humira once her infections have resolved. # Hidradenitis: She should follow-up with her primary care physician and dermatologist regarding long-term management of her hidradenitis. # Normocytic anemia: Work-up of the anemia is left to the discretion of her primary care provider.","You came because of abdominal pain.

We gave you three days of steroids and an antibiotic called azithromycin. You should continue azithromycin for two more days. You also told us that you had some trouble swallowing. We did a CT scan which showed that some of your esophagus, or swallowing tube, was being compressed probably because you have a history of thyroid cancer. We did a test that measures your swallowing ability and found that you should try to eat softer foods and your pills should be crushed before you take them.","```json

Cardiac issues were considered less likely given negative troponin tests and no elevated D-dimer or BNP levels on admission EKG was non-specific with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% in the past, which now appears to have resolved as heart function improved during your stay. The primary concern upon discharge includes managing chronic alcohol withdrawal symptoms without seizures and continuing treatment for pancreatitis risk due to elevated liver enzymes but not definitive based on lipase results alone, with persistent epigastric pain suggesting peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. Anemia management is key here; while microcytosis points towards possible GIB without confirmed bleeding yet and screening colonoscopy has been advised for thorough assessment despite no overt blood in stool symptoms, an EGD might be considered subsequently due to ongoing alcohol abuse raising concerns of chronic gastritis or ulceration. Your diabetes management required adjustments as metformin was discontinued temporarily because of potential lactic acidosis risk with increased ethanol intake, and insulin therapy has been initiated during your hospital stay; follow-up is arranged next week for continued inpatient or outpatient alcohol detoxification based on further evaluation. Seizure history due to etoh abuse was noted but no withdrawal seizures occurred over the course of treatment, and home medication continuity with Keppra has been maintained. Discharge plans include folate supplementation for nutritional support amid chronic alcohol misuse and social work intervention is underway to facilitate engagement in outpatient Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, as you've expressed a strong desire for abstinence from etoh. Please ensure follow-up appointments with the primary care clinic and substance use specialist are not missed after discharge, specifically on ___ at 5PM to discuss inpatient vs outpatient detoxification options, Intake at AtCare is due tomorrow morning for further evaluation regarding this matter.

"Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of HTN, IDDMII c/b gastroparesis, peripheral neuropathy, GERD, constipation, cholelithiasis, history of abdominal necrotizing fasciitis now presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting consistent with prior gastroparesis flares. HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: # Gastroparesis flare The patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, suspected due to flare of gastroparesis. Other possible contributions including constipation and GERD. Patient has history of cholelithiasis, but pain atypical of biliary colic. Lipase within normal limits. KUB without acute process. She improved with conservative/supportive treatment including bowel rest with slow advancement of diet, pain medications (initially IV morphine, then oxycodone/APAP/ibuprofen), and antiemetics (lorazepam due to prolonged QTc). She improved with these measure and was tolerating a regular diet and pain-free at the time of discharge. # IDDMI # Hyperglycemia: Last A1c 7.2% on ___. Home regimen is Levemir 14 units Qam and 12 units QPM. She was treated with a reduced dose of her insulin while not tolerating PO. Her home regimen was resumed on discharge as she was eating and drinking normally. # Dysuria Patient recently completed course of antibiotics for UTI, but reported ongoing dysuria. Repeat UA was not consistent with UTI. # Acute kidney injury (resolved with IV fluids) Pre-renal azotemia in setting of poor oral intake and vomiting. # Prolonged QTc Likely due to medication effect from multiple Qt prolonging medications including metoclopramide and citalopram. Her QTc improved after holding these meds. On discharge, her citalopram was changed to sertraline and her metoclopramide was held. # Leukocytosis (resolved after IV fluids): Likely due to hemoconcentration. No fevers. Patient was recently treated for urinary tract infection. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # Hypertension: - Not on any agents # GERD: - PO famotidine and omeprazole # Anemia: Hb was normal in setting of hemoconcentration on admission. H/H was trended. # Post-partum depression. She was recently started on citalopram which was held on admission due to prolonged QTc. Citalopram was changed to sertaline on discharge. >30 minutes spent on complex discharge","You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain, nausea, and inability to take in oral liquids/food due to a gastroparesis flare. Most likely this was triggered by your recent urinary tract infection. You were treated with supportive care (bowel rest, anti-nausea medicines, pain medicines) and your symptoms improved. You also had some kidney injury due to dehydration which resolved with IV fluids. You had a segment of your EKG (heart electrical conduction) that was slightly prolonged due to the effect of multiple medications you were taking. This can be dangerous because it can cause a fatal rhythm problem in your heart.","```json

Your treatment included bowel rest accompanied by the gradual reintroduction of foods while managing pain using IV morphine initially, then transitioning to oral oxycodone/APAP along with antiemetics like lorazepam for persistent nausea linked to prolonged QTc syndrome. A prior abdominal necrotizing fasciitis history was deemed unlikely due to the nature of your pain and imaging findings, yet it remained a consideration in case symptoms worsened or changed significantly during admission despite no new evidence on repeat labs indicating an infectious process such as urinary tract infection.

Additionally, you managed concurrent issues with hyperglycemia associated with diabetes mellitus and had your insulin dosage adjusted due to suboptimal oral intake but resumed the usual regimen upon recovery from acute illnesses by discharge day 4-5. Dysuria was reported, though subsequent urinalysis did not support ongoing infection beyond initial treatment received before admission for a UTI two weeks earlier—likely irritation post antibiotic therapy instead of persistent bacterial presence or reinfection at this point during your stay.

Kidney function tests initially suggested acute kidney injury likely from dehydration resulting in pre-renal azotemia, which responded well to fluid replacement without the need for dialysis intervention and is expected to resolve completely with ongoing adequate hydration post discharge. Your leukocytosis at admission was attributed to hemoconcentration from poor oral intake due to gastroparesis symptoms, which ameliorated after initiating rehydration therapy and resolving vomiting episodes; no ongoing signs of infection were present.

Chronic conditions such as hypertension remained stable without active treatment during your stay but are an important aspect for continued outpatient management to avoid future complications, including the risk associated with post-partum depression—for which you have started sertraline after holding off citalopram due to its potential effect on prolonging QTc. The overall course of treatment was complex and required careful balance between managing your acute presentation while monitoring and adjusting therapy for existing chronic conditions without causing further complications, culminating in a discharge with outpatient follow-up plans including blood pressure checks to monitor the risk factors that are associated with hypertension.","['Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting consistent with gastroparesis flares', 'Acute kidney injury (pre-renal azotemia)', 'Leukocytosis (likely due to hemoconcentration)']","['Improvement of gastroparesis symptoms with conservative/supportive treatment', 'Resolution of acute kidney injury with IV fluids', 'Identification and management of prolonged QTc with medication adjustments']","['Resume home insulin regimen (Levemir 14 units Qam and 12 units QPM)', 'Change citalopram to sertraline']",3,3,2

She was initially treated empirically with vancomycin (for enterococcus), Cipro, and Flagyl. Per OSH, blood culture from ___ grew pan-sensitive K pneumo (docs in chart). Once this information was available, antibiotic coverage was narrowed to Unasyn. Blood culture at ___ on ___ showed GNRs, those since ___ NGTD. The patient was on 10 day Cipro course in ___, so there is concern for resistance, giving preference to non-Cipro regimens. ERCP ___ showed small filling defect, sludge, pus. Sphincterotomy performed. Following ERCP she was afebrile and had only mild abdominal pain. As she was tolerating PO well and was afebrile, she was discharged home with Augmentin for a total 14 day course from the last positive blood culture. . # Shortness of breath: The patient subjective dyspnea and chest wall soreness initially. Pain resolved as her infection improved. No oxygen supplementation was necessary, although the patient used oxygen for comfort for several hours. Her symptoms were entirely resolved on discharge. . # Neck pain: Likely secondary to ERCP positioning, exacerbated by history of cervical disc disease. Resolved with Ativan for muscle relaxation and Tylenol for pain relief. The patient could not use NSAIDs due to ERCP. . # Hyperglycemia: The patient was found to be hyperglycemic on presentation. She was placed on an insulin drip, but was not able to be weaned from the drip in the emergency department, leading to an admission to the ICU. After a few hours she was stable to transfer to the general medical floor. She remained on an ISS during her stay, and was discharged on her home diabetes regimen. . # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Initially presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis, thought to be secondary to both hyperglycemia and mildly elevated lactate. Rapidly resolved with hydration. # ST changes on EKG: On presentation, found to have some diffuse ST changes, likely demand ischemia in setting of acute process and rapid rate. Cardiac monitoring in the ICU saw no recurrence, follow-up EKGs normal. Recommend outpatient stress test. . # Code: Full .

You were found to have cholangitis, an infection of the biliary system of the liver. An ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) was performed which drained this infection. You were found to have bacteria in your bloodstream, likely due to this infection of the biliary tract. You were treated with antibiotics, initially a set of three antibiotics for broad coverage. This was reduced to a single agent, augmentin as blood cultures revealed the bacteria causing the infection. When you arrived to our hospital, you were found to have high blood glucose. You were given an continuous insulin infusion to treat this condition, which rapidly resolved. While you were on the insulin infusion you were in our ICU, however once it was discontinued you were moved to a general medicine floor. We used an insulin sliding scale to control your blood sugar during your stay, as you were eating irregularly. There is no need to change your home regimen. Given the severity of a blood-borne infection, you need to continue the antibiotics for a total of two weeks from the time of your last positive blood culture.

The initial CT scan did not show any abnormalities related to the cholangitis symptoms, leading you to be treated empirically without confirmation of specific pathogens or issues on imaging studies at this time. Treatment was then promptly adjusted once pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia (K pneumo) from blood cultures led the medical team to focus narrow antibiotic therapy, specifically Unasyn which is a broad spectrum cephalosporin with better coverage against K pneumo.

While under care for your infection and cholangitis-related symptoms (including shortness of breath), neck pain developed likely due to the positioning during ERCP procedures, as well as exacbotomy from underlying cervical disc disease which was relieved with Ativan for muscle relaxation. 

Your hospital course also involved managing hyperglycemia leading to admission in ICU on a temporary insulin drip after initial management failed due to the severity of your diabetes, later weaned and continued monitoring without needing intensive interventions while transitioning back to general wards. Anion gap metabolic acidosis also presented initially likely from high glucose levels but rapidly resolved with proper hydration treatment during ICU stay before continuation of your home diabetes management plan upon discharge.

Shortness of breath due to the underlying infection showed improvement as well, eliminating a need for supplemental oxygen beyond comfort use and resolving without any complications within 24 hours after admission. Code Pink was not necessary despite some transient ST changes on EKG initially thought to be related to demand ischemia secondary to the acute medical situation; these normalized quickly with no further episodes throughout your ICU stay or follow-up care, and an outpatient stress test will need scheduling as a precaution.

On discharge planning, you were instructed on continuing treatment for infection until 14 days post last positive blood culture while monitoring liver function tests to consider reinstituting statins if appropriate based upon LFT results and discussions with your healthcare provider about follow-up care as well. Additionally, an appointment was arranged or requested by you after consultation with the primary care physician (PCP) for post-discharge evaluation including a stress test due to initial EKG findings during admission; it is imperative that this be scheduled promptly even if your PCP has no immediate availability.","['Cholangitis complicated by K. pneumo bacteremia', 'Hyperglycemia requiring insulin drip and ICU admission', 'Shortness of breath']","['Diagnosis of K. pneumo bacteremia and antibiotic narrowing', 'Management of hyperglycemia with insulin drip']","['Outpatient stress test', 'Check LFTs and restart statin as appropriate']",3,2,2

"Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ female with AML status post a core transplantation on ___ transferred for ___ ___ with fevers, chills, and rigors, and GNR bacteremia. 1. E. coli Bacteremia: transferred from outside hospital with + blood cultures from ___ that was later speciated as e. coli (resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and bactrim). The most likely etiology of bacteremia was a UTI, given initial sx of dysuria and + urinalysis. There was no evidence of pyelonephritis such as flank pain/ CVA tenderness or WBC casts on urinalysis. CXR also showed no evidence of pneumonia. Given immunosuppression and history of e.coli UTIs sensitive to cefepime, the patient was initially placed on cefepime while awaiting culture results. Given persistent high grade fevers and SIRS like physiology with tachycardia and leukocytosis, the patient was also initially ordered to receive vancomycin. However 15 minutes into vancomycin infusion, she developed severe pruritis and antibiotics were stopped. At this time, final speciation of blood culture from the OSH was received and the need for gram positive coverage was felt to be unnecessary. On ___, the patient was noted to have relative eosinophilia and new rash (see below), so cefepime was switched to aztreonam. Surveillance blood and urine cultures drawn on admission remained negative. Patient was treated with IV antibiotics as above and supportively with IV fluids and acetaminophen as needed. Once patient had been afebrile for > 48 hrs, she was started on PO ciprofloxacin. Discharged with instructions to complete a two week course of antibiotics from first negative blood culture on ___. Of note, initial CXR showed new cardiomegaly, although because it was a portable film, accurate heart size could not be fully assessed. Given the history of cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, an ECHO was done to further evaluate. ECHO showed no new abnormalities or depressed cardiac function. 2. Eosinophilia: On ___ patient was noted to have a new diffuse macular- papular rash and eosinophilia in context of being on cefepime and having a pruritic reaction to the initial infusion of vancomycin. Although the patient has received both of these antibiotics in the past without complications, there was concern for an allergic reaction so cefepime was switched to aztreonam and vancomycin was discontinued. The patient also complained of several episodes of loose stool, and given history of cord transplantation there was concern for stage 2 GVHD. With lack of recent risk factors, an infectious etiology for eosinophilia was thought to be unlikely. A limited evaluation for parasitic infection returned negative. Eosinophilia increased from 5% to 17% on ___ and rash did not clinically improve. On ___, the patient was started on an empiric course of Prednisone 20mg with expected resolution of eosinophilia. Discharged with short taper of steroids, with the instruction to maintain a high suspicion for any additional signs of GVHD. 3. AML s/p transplant: Questionable stage 2 GVHD as above.

While recovering, we also observed an incidental finding of hyponatremia that did not present concerning symptoms but required monitoring to avoid volume depletion issues due to the underlying diabetes and hypertension conditions you manage long-term. As a result, careful attention was given to your fluid intake with sodium levels being adjusted accordingly using both oral and IV fluids when needed.

During this hospital stay, we continue managing various chronic medical issues such as diabetes (with insulin sliding scale), hypertension (re-initiated losartan 50 mg once daily after resolving slight renal function concerns), hyperlipidemia with rosuvastatin continuation, and rheumatoid arthritis treatment. We've also been treating your iron deficiency anemia at home and managing GERD symptoms effectively with ongoing medications including omeprazole 20 mg daily which you tolerated well without any complaints of heartburn or acid reflux episodes during admission, signifying a good response to therapy.

As part of your discharge plan focused on transitional issues and continued care at home: Care Group Home Care services will be important for maintaining health stability following hospitalization with the help provided by skilled nursing staff. We recommend encouraging daily fluid intake, aiming for 1.5-2 liters per day to prevent dehydration while also managing your diabetes and hypertension needs adequately through continued medication adherence including lantus (for insulin), losartan (after resolving the mild creatinine elevation observed during hospitalization) albuterol inhaler with spacer to ensure optimal drug delivery, guaifenesin for cough suppression if needed post-discharge, and other routine medications like folic acid, vitamin D.

Given the location of these findings, they were thought to consistent with the cause of her dyskinesias. Her dyskinesias improved and appeared resolved at the time of discharge. She appeared well and at her baseline throughout the entire admission aside from hypertension. Differential diagnosis for her imaging findings initially included Wilsons, carbon monoxide poisoning, Wernickes, lymphoma, viral etiologies (including flaviviruses: ___ encephalitis, ___ virus), PRES, osmotic demyelination, Sjogrens, ADEM, and atypical MS. ___ causes of her imaging findings that were thought to be less likely were hypoxic injury as there was no clear episode of hypotension or hypoxemia, though these both could have occurred intraoperatively.

Maintaining Professional Tone: In the given medical summary of a patient with an extensive background, ensure that you maintain a professional tone while simplifying complex terms. Avoid using any direct quotes from the provided text and instead paraphrase to create a coherent narrative about the patient's condition and treatment plan in your own words within 1000 characters without abbreviations or medical jargon that laypeople might not understand:

You were admitted with abnormal, involuntary movements affecting various parts of your body including your face. These strange movements seemed to be caused by a disorder linked to the size and function of certain brain areas known as thalamus but weren't related to any recent strokes or other serious illnesses such as infections, tumors, or blood-related issues based on our tests. You also had high blood pressure that required us to adjust your medication regimen during your stay and continue monitoring it closely after you leave. Despite these health challenges, the abnormal movements subsided by themselves without requiring further immediate treatment such as injections into your spine or a special dye test for your brain (MRI with contrast). We also looked at various blood tests to rule out other causes of similar symptoms and found that certain deficiencies were not present. You did have slightly low levels of vitamin B12, but nothing else in the workup pointed towards an alternative cause for these movements besides your known medical history which includes thyroid disorder (Grave's disease), kidney issues, lung condition related to reduced oxygen over a long time (COPD) and heart-related high blood pressure. Additionally, you were on medications including ones that control high cholesterol levels in the body fluids without any adjustments needed during your stay, but will be monitored closely due to changes made for managing hypertension at home with more frequent checks required.

Per patient's PCP her baseline SBP is usually recorded at 140s, with Altace as her only blood pressure medication. Pt was started on PO Amlodipine and IV Hydralazine in addition to her home regimen of Altace. With this regimen patient's blood pressures improved. Patient was then transitioned to a purely PO regimen of Amlodipine, Altace and Metoprolol Succinate 75mg daily. Patient likely with essential hypertension but patient did have a thyroid panel that was normal and a renal U/S that showed no renal arterial stenosis. Prior to discharge her blood pressure ranged from 128-149/66-90. ## Sinus Tachycardia: Patient was also noted to tachycardic up to 120-130. Patient was worked up thoroughly which included an Echo which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function (EF 80%), lower extemity dopplers and CTA were negative for DVT and Pulmonary Embolism respectively. Sinus tachycardia did not resolve with daily Librium, and was not related to pain, anxiety, fevers or volume status. After confirmation that sinus tachycardia was not due to a pathologic state other than deconditioning, patient was started on Metoprolol.

Any future encounters for pain without objective evidence should be cautiously treated. #Diarrhea: Pt. has a history of c dif infections, per report, and presented with reports of watery diarrhea for three days and concern for reinfection. She was seen at ___ ___ and empirically prescribed oral flagyl, although she was unable to provide a stool sample. On this admission patient reported continuing diarrhea since being seen at ___, with worsening abdominal pain. However in the hospital she never had diarrhea, no leukocytosis and no c/f colitis on CT imaging. Eventual stool sample was given which was neg for cdiff; flagyl stopped. #Abdominal pain: Pt presented with RLQ and epigastric pain in the context of ___ days watery diarrhea. She has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and c dif infections. A CT abdomen was negative for any acute abdominal process, and her white blood cell count, lactate, and electrolytes were within normal limits. She remained afebrile with normal vitals throughout her hospital stay. She was started on dilaudid 1 mg IV Q3H:PRN pain and subsequently switched to oral oxycodone. Surgery was consulted in the ED and did not feel her abdominal pain was related to any acute surgical issue. They recommended follow up with her bariatric surgeon. The pt requested transfer multiple times to ___, per her report at the request of her surgeon; after calling her surgeon, we discovered the patient had never spoken w her, and she declined transfer. After declining escalation of narcotics, she immediately felt better and wanted to be discharged. TRANSITIONAL ISSUSES -narcotic rx concern: patient has history of narcotic and benzo medication rx from many providers on ___ monthly basis without utox positivity. Would recommend hesitant rx of narcotics or benzos if presents with pain without objective evidence.","Ms ___, You were admitted to ___ with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. We were concerned about a C. dif. infection given your prior infections and your recent visit to ___, where you were started on oral flagyl to treat a possible infection. We treated a possible C. diff. infection by giving you IV flagyl. We were not able to send a stool sample in the hospital initially because you were not having diarrhea, so we could not confirm the infection. We transitioned you to oral flagyl. Once we were able to get a stool sample it was sent and you were found not to have a C. diff infection. Your oral flagyl was discontinued. We also gave you IV fluids, pain medications, nausea medications, and bowel rest. A CT scan of your abdomen was reassuring. It showed that your colon and pancreas were normal. There were no signs of infections or inflammation on the scan. Our surgery team evaluated you in the emergency department and recommended that you follow up with your bariatric surgeon.","```json

Inpatient treatment involved confrontation regarding this issue leading to a candid discussion on narcotics abuse and efforts were made to contact her previous healthcare providers for clarification, though many remained unaware of the multiple prescriptions until then. 

Concurrently dealing with watery diarrhea without objective evidence like leukocytosis or CT findings led to empirical antibiotic treatment which was ceased after a stool test negated C. difficile as the cause, and she did not have inpatient episodes of abdominal pain requiring narcotics for more than two days before her requesting transfer from one healthcare facility to another without prior communication—a decision that resulted in hospital staff declining transfers based on insufficient acute issues. 

In summary, your care highlighted concerns about the appropriateness of repeated and uncorrelated prescriptions for narcotics and benzodiazepines from various providers without a clear medical basis or communication between these entities in managing chronic pain conditions while also ensuring appropriate attention to potential gastrointestinal issues. Moving forward, this incident underscores the importance of coordinated care among all your healthcare providers and cautious prescribing when it comes to narcotics for any future encounters without objective evidence.","['Abdominal pain', 'Diarrhea with concern for C. diff reinfection', 'Narcotics seeking behavior and suspected misuse']","['Confrontation regarding extensive narcotic prescription history from multiple providers', 'Negative diagnostic workup for diarrhea and abdominal pain (no C. diff, no acute abdominal process on CT)']",['Cautious prescribing of narcotics and benzodiazepines for pain without objective evidence'],3,2,1
"Brief Hospital Course: Interval Events: On repeat examination (after exam documented above), she was found to be unresponsive with eyes deviated left, left-beating nystagmus, and subtle left head turn. NCSE was suspected and she was given LZP immediately. Nystagmus continued intermittently despite 2mg LZP and she was given another 2mg after ___ minutes. She required intubation shortly thereafter because of airway protection (dropping SaO2 to ___, secretional) and was started on propofol which also had the effect of breaking her status (which by that point had progressed to hand shaking). Home Keppra dose was increased from 1000 mg BID to ___ BID ___ given in ED) with proposal. Hospital Course: ___ was admitted to the ICU in guarded condition. EEG monitoring was initiated after receiving lorazepam, levetiracetam and propofol; the tracing showed burst suppression with no evidence of electrographic seizures. She remained electrographically and clinically free of seizures. A repeat workup to determine the etiology of her seizures was conducted and was notable for MRI with two small (3-mm) foci of diffusion restriction consistent with stroke; cytology was negative and TB PCR is pending. Her strokes were thought to be secondary to her known atrial fibrillation, with minimal clinical significance. No new etiology of her seizures was identified and the most likely cause remains underlying small vessel disease with residual abnormalities characterized on MRI. Her hospital course was complicated by a failure to wean from the ventilator. Bronchoscopy was performed and secretions were concerning for pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and cultures were positive for MRSA. She underwent a course of treatment for MRSA pneumonia. Her failure to wean was attributed to her pneumonia as well as scarring given her history of pulmonary tuberculosis. With treatment of her pneumonia she was able to wean from the ventilator. Her oxygen requirement resolved. On admission, her troponins were mildly elevated but plateaued at 0.14. This was attributed to strain in the context of seizure and acute medical illness. No intervention was performed. For her atrial fibrillation, her coumadin was held in anticipation of lumbar puncture and she was started on a heparin drip. Her anticogaulation was subsequently switched to fondiparinux given concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. HIT antibodies were sent and were negative. Her heparin was restarted and her platelet count recovered without intervention. Her coumadin was restarted. She was transitioned to a lovenox bridge in preparation for discharge. She was evaluated by physical therapy who saw that she was decondittioned and recommended rehabilitation versus home with 24 hour supervision. The patient and her family strongly preferred to go home with 24 hour rehabilitation and home physical therapy. CT chest showed an incidental finding of soft tissue thickening in the abdomen, concerning for possible recurrence of GI lymphoma. Her recent lymphoma recurrence had been located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, per discussion with her oncologist's fellow, the known location of cancer was consistent with these new findings. She should follow up with her oncologist on discharge.","You were admitted to the hospital because ___ were having a seizure. We increased the dose of your anti-seizure medication, Keppra, and ___ did not have any more seizures. While you were here we did more tests to investigate the cause of your seizures, including a lumbar puncture and an MRI of your brain. There was no sign of an infection of your nervous system. Your MRI did show two very small strokes which we believe were due to your atrial fibrillation. We do not think that this was the cause of your seizures. It is important that ___ continue to take the coumadin to reduce the likelihood of any further strokes. While you were here you were found to have a pneumonia. ___ had a bronchoscopy to look at your lungs. We treated ___ with antibiotics for your pneumonia. This pneumonia made it difficult for ___ to come off of the ventilator. ___ are currently receiving antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. ___ will complete four more days of treatment. ___ were evaluated by physical therapy who noticed that ___ were very weak from your stay in the hospital. We recommended that ___ continue to receive physical therapy, and that ___ will need 24 hour assistance while ___ are getting back on your feet. We will arrange for home physical therapy.

Despite administering Lorazepam and Propofol which helped with NCSE symptoms but also led to hand shaking due to the breakthrough seizures caused by these interventions; hence an increase in Keppra dosage was necessary for better control of epilepsy at this stage, subsequently prescribed as 2g BID administered intravenously.
In addition to your ongoing antiepileptic therapy, you were found to have small foci consistent with a previous stroke due to underlying chronic disease and strain from the recent medical stressors like seizures; this was not deemed significant in causing NCSE but could be contributing to long-standing changes that might predispose one to such events. Furthermore, you developed an MRSA pneumonia likely linked with your ICU stay which complicated weaning off mechanical ventilation and extended the length of hospitalization as additional therapeutic interventions were required along with bronchoalveolar lavage for a thorough workup due to abnormal secretions.
Cardiac concerns related to atrial fibrillation led you undergo anticoagulation management initially using heparin before switching treatments because of potential risks, which was then managed effectively without complications as your troponin levels normalized and platelet count recovered in the absence of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia. You were transitioned to Lovenox for long-term anticoagulation before planned discharge planning began with physical therapy, which concluded successfully at home under 24 hour supervision as per family's preference against acute inpatient rehab services despite ongoing GI lymphoma concerns evident from a CT scan.

Your condition also included diabetes mellit0us type 2 (DM2) that became uncontrolled during your stay, which was managed with medication adjustments. Additionally, you had depression and a thyroid nodule noted on MRI but were found to be non-cancerous after fine needle aspiration cytology revealed no malignancy in the pathogenic study conducted by an endocrinologist.

The initial source of your spinal osteomyelitis was unclear, and you underwent a bone biopsy that identified pan-sensitive coagulase negative staph as being responsible for the condition; treatment with intravenous antibiotics commenced immediately following this discovery. While an epidural phlegmon showed signs of resolution on subsequent MRI scans, you left against medical advice from a skilled nursing facility (SNF) due to dissatisfaction and escalating back pain despite the treatment with IV cefazolin through your port-a-catheter. You were discharged home after an extended period of inpatient care along with ongoing antibiotic therapy, a limited supply of low dose oxycodone for breakthrough pain which is to be tapered as you continue recovering from the spinal epidural abscess and active MS.

Your complex medical history also includes chronic back issues due to disk disease, hypo-density in lumbar vertebrae on X-rays, cervical cord signal changes after steroid treatment for multiple sclerosis exacerbation with the aid of baclofen and gabapentin. Your diabetes is now well controlled under medical supervision following a significant spike during your hospitalization from high dose corticosteroid use to manage an MS flare-up, requiring additional monitoring through weekly blood work for complete blood count (CBC) with differentials as part of ongoing assessment.

You were recommended several follow-up appointments and procedures but did not opt into rehabilitation therapies at the time; instead, you chose home IV cefazolin treatments under ID team's direction after discharge from inpatient care before your PICC line removal is scheduled. An outpatient ocrelizumab treatment plan was discussed with consideration of completing it once all antibiotics for the spinal epidural abscess are finished, which should be beyond 30 minutes since you discharged from inpatient care under comprehensive coordination to establish your aftercare at home.

Additionally, a thyroid ultrasound confirmed a large cystic nodule without suspicion of malignancy and it's recommended that follow-up fine needle aspiration be scheduled for further investigation into the nature of this finding while maintaining euthyroid status with normal TSH levels. The patient expressed ongoing anxiety contributing to their depression, which is managed by continuing bupropion therapy as prescribed previously inpatient care setting along with other medications appropriate for chronic back pain management and multiple sclerosis symptomatic relief.

Overall, your course through the hospital was multifaceted due to a combination of recent diagnosis of MS alongside acute medical conditions requiring intravenous antibiotics therapy; mental health support continued throughout treatment for anxiety-related depression and plans were made concerning further evaluation of thyroid nodule. Your outpatient neurology team will continue overseeing your multiple sclerosis management, with the consideration to commence ocrelizumab upon full resolution from infection as per their guidance based on recent progress noted during hospitalization.","['Persistent back pain', 'L5/S1 discitis/osteomyelitis', 'Active Multiple Sclerosis']","['Repeat MRI demonstrating L5-S1 discitis with near resolution of epidural phlegmon', 'Administration of 3-day course of methylprednisolone for active MS', 'Optimization of pain management regimen']","['Complete 6 weeks of home IV cefazolin for osteomyelitis', 'Weekly CBC with differential, BUN, Cr monitoring', 'FNA of thyroid nodule']",3,3,3

The surgery was uneventful with no complications. Immediately afterward, you received heparin prophylaxis as per protocol for postoperative DVT prevention while continuing intravenous antibiotics over 24 hours following the procedure to combat infection risks from open surgery and anesthesia use. Your pain management strategy included oral and IV medications, which successfully alleviated initial discomforts until you regained normal bowel function prompting removal of nasogastric tube (NGT). 

However, during your fifth postoperative day in the hospital on a PACU bed, abdominal pain along with distension and nausea led to further investigations via KUB imaging. The test showed stacked loops of small bowel consistent with ileus - an expected but troublesome complication after surgery that temporarily stops intestinal movement which can cause bloating, discomfort and vomiting without bile in the stomach content as seen when NGT was emptied. You were then made nil per os (NPO) with IV fluids except medications to support your hydration while continuing heparin therapy for DVT prevention until you could resume oral intake, which occurred on the following day without incidents. 

Your blood pressure management was complicated by being nil per os and unable to take some home medications; hence an extra input from your medicine team helped in better controlling it through a modified drug regimen while considering potential changes after you start taking meals again. A subsequent CT scan identified an anterior abdominal wall hernia containing loop of small bowel, which likely resulted because the healing process had not fully mended yet and was later corrected under OR by your Acute Care Surgery team with mesh reinforcement for support - no complications noted post-suture. 

Your hemoglobin level dropped to a worrying low on this day; hence blood products were transfused, increasing the hematocrit appropriately and ensuring stable levels thereafter without any signs of further bleeding into your abdominal cavity as per followup CT scans after surgery. This improved hemoglobin allowed you to be moved from Surgical ICU back onto general ward bed on that same day, where routine care continued - physical and occupational therapy for mobilization was introduced immediately following transfer with progressive goals of walking outdoors as well as performing activities in daily life like grooming or bathing. 

By the next couple days postoperative period while continuously receiving IV heparin prophylaxis, your bladder issues improved to an extent that allowed you to void urine independently without a catheter by day six and discontinued antibiotics on this same day with no signs of infection. As time progressed towards the end of hospital stay during which all vitals remained stable - heart rate, blood pressure, temperature were consistently normal; oxygen saturation was good even at lower respiratory tract level without any need for supplemental O2 as you continued to take deep breathing exerses and mobilization every day. The pain decreased steadily through the days post-op with oral medications that became less frequent, until it ceased completely by late third hospital stay period; allowing good functional ability on physical therapy's part during this time frame as well before discharge readiness assessment started to be made in terms of nutrition and mobility. 

Finally after a thorough review with the patient along with his family, upon understanding all instructions provided by your healthcare team for post-discharge plan including physical activity levels, dietary adjustments especially related to fiber intake as well medication compliance (including continuing heparin treatment at home now and not just in hospital setting), followup appointments with spine surgery specialist doctor and gastroenterologist for your hernia within two weeks of discharge, the decision was made on this day to send you back safely into community care under these conditions.","['Anterior lumbar interbody fusion L4-5', 'Anterior lumbar interbody fusion L5-S1', 'Anterior exposure assistance by Vascular Surgery']",['Underwent Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (L4-5 and L5-S1)'],[],3,1,0

During your stay, you experienced transient hypoxia on admission day but recovered well overnight in high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy, allowing weaning off supplementary oxygen the next morning with normal saturations upon discharge. Ongoing odynophagia was likely linked to hepatic inflammation and has been managed conservatively without clear infectious causes identified by EGD; your diet is advanced as tolerated, pending biopsy results for follow-up outside the hospital. Abdominal pain chronic in nature with more acute episodes recently tended towards a non-specific hepatic etiology rather than cholangitis or gallstones and was managed effectively on oxycodone without needing further invasive investigation while discharged home. Incontinence, once an issue for you prior to admission but not present during your hospital stay, is likely related to the decreased skin integrity from chronic prednisone use; it's being treated with topical medications and appropriate wound care at this time. A facial zoster infection has resolved without needing further oral antiviral treatment due to prior therapy completion over 10 days ago, while potential Lyme disease is also considered given the rash findings on your buttocks and feet—this requires outpatient follow-up with a dermatologist. Adequate management of hyperglycemia during steroid use was provided through home insulin therapy (HISS).

"Brief Hospital Course: ___ male with an extensive peripheral vascular surgical history including a failed left fem pop bypass with PTFE culminating in a left above knee amputation. After his amputation he was noted to have a draining sinus from his amp site and it was eventually found that his PTFE graft was infected. He went to the OR and the majority of the PTFE graft was taken out however a small cuff of graft was left in place at the proximal anastomosis of the groin. Since that operation he has had episodes of bleeding, hematoma, and infection in the left groin. He presented to the emergency room with complaints of spontaneous bleeding from the left groin. He was then taken to the OR for exploration. During the operation cultures were obtained then the groin was opened and washed out. There was no signs of gross infection. The residual PTFE graft was oversewn to stop the bleeding and a sartorius muscle flap was placed over the exposed graft to reduce infection risk. A VAC dressing was then placed. For details of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to the vascular surgery floor where he remained through the rest of the hospitalization. His wound vac was changed on POD3 and healthy granulation tissue was noted. He was then switched to a wet-to-dry dressing in preparation for discharge to rehab, where a wound vac will again be placed. Infectious Disease was consulted and based on the culture data and sensitivities recommended meropenem while inpatient and discharge on IV Ertapenem 1g q24 for 6 weeks, followed by chronic suppressive oral antibiotics, the course of which will be determined on outpatient OPAT follow-up. He remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course, and his WBC remained <10. The patient worked with Physical therapy throughout his hospital course, which recommended rehab. He did have some difficulty with voiding after the Foley was removed, for which his Flomax was increased to 0.8 qhs. He remained A&OX3 and hemodynamically stable throughout his course. On POD 4, the patient was deemed ready for discharge to rehab. He was able to tolerate a regular diet, work with physical therapy, void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions. He will be discharged on IV Ertapenem 1g q24 daily for 6 weeks, he will continue his home dose of Apixaban 5mg BID for history of DVT, he will continue aspirin 81mg daily lifelong, and he will have Tylenol and tramadol for pain control. He will be discharged to rehab for IV antibiotics, wound vac care (black foam at 125mmHg, change every 3 days), and physical therapy. The patient will have appointments set up for Infectious disease, and will follow-up with Vascular surgery in 2 weeks.","You were admitted to the hospital secondary to bleeding from your left groin. Because you have had extensive surgery to the left groin with synthetic graft in the area we were very concerned that this bleeding was secondary to infection. CT scan showed no change to the area but there was continued oozing so you were taken to the OR for exploration of the left groin. We obtained cultures from the wound in the OR after we washed out the left groin, oversewed the residual graft to stop the bleeding, and covered the area with a muscle flap and placed a VAC to improve healing and reduce the risk of further infection. The infectious disease team was consulted and recommended IV ertapenem 1g q24 for 6 weeks followed by oral suppressive antibiotics. They based this recommendation off of the micro-organisms growing from your wound and sensitivities demonstrated.","```json

Workup has been notable for imaging of spine w enhancing cauda equina nerve roots and lumbar disc herniation. Of note, further review of the imaging by neuroradiology was somewhat inconclusive, and it is unclear if there truly was nerve root enhancement, or possibly just signal from nearby veins. EMG revealed axon loss bilaterally in L3-L4 region without evidence of demyelination. In addition, she has a pro-thrombotic state with multiple DVTs and pulmonary embolism on her imaging, for which we started heparin anticoagulation.

"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old female with hx of COPD/restrictive lung disease, T1-T2 paraplegia s/p MVA with chronic pain, and recent history of recurrent pneumonias who presents w/ SOB and increased oxygen requirement with CXR concerning for another recurrence of PNA as well as known ESBL UTI. . ACTIVE ISSUES . #. Shortness of breath and O2 requirement: Her decreased neuromuscular strength and inability to clear her secretions could be underlying cause for recurrent infections, despite frequent chest physiotherapy. However, it was considered that this exacerbation may not be infectious, but with the development of hypotension and her O2 requirement, we decided to start broad-spectrum antibiotics initially. CTA chest showed some filling defects in left upper and lower pulmonary vessels (similar to prior) with a new ground-glass opacity on the left suggesting infection. Given her improved clinical status, baseline O2 requirement, lack of fever or leukocytosis, we felt comfortable discontinuing her broad-coverage antibiotics for healthcare associated pneumonia coverage despite this radiological finding. She was continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed. Her PCA continued to perform chest ___ on her while in house and she did begin to mobilize her secretions. She was discharged off antibiotics. #. CoNS in blood cultures: Blood cultures taken from the PICC line upon admission grew caogulase negative S. aureus. We initially covered with Vancomycin and pulled the PICC line until further data was available. When cultures were repeated, only those from ___ were positive, representing a likely contaminant. The PICC line tip culture itself did not grow anything. She remained afebrile and did not show any systemic signs of infection. . #. Recurrent UTIs: She was admitted on ertapenem for treatment of an ESBL Klebsiella Urine culture showed no growth. Given her spinal cord injury and frequent straight caths, she is prone to UTIs but will not be traditionally symptomatic. She was changed to meropenem on admission. LFTs were checked, given incidence of LFT abnormalities on the penems. A Foley catheter was placed despite the UTI because she normally gets straight catheterized every ___ hours and that would not have been possible on the general medicine floor. She finished a 7-day antibiotic course while in house and was discharged off all antibiotics. . # CTA findings: Soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal recess (stable since ___ and right hilar LAD (increased since prior study) may need further evaluation with MRI. Please see full CTA report for more details. If MRI is not done, a follow-up contrast-enhanced CT would be recommended in 3 months to ensure this LAD is indeed reactive. These are recommendations from Radiology. . INACTIVE ISSUES . #. T1-T2 paraplegia with chronic pain: Patient does complain of some pain in her legs, but is on a home regimen that seems to work quite well for her. With any sedating pain regimen, there is always a concern for CO2 retention/slowed respiratory rate. She was perfectly stable on her pain regimen without any changes in mental status or breathing pattern. She was continued on baclofen, methadone, oxycodone, pregabalin and a bowel regimen of PEG and Dulcolax. Oxybutynin was continued for urinary retention. . #.

As a longstanding MS sufferer of this young woman's age who had recently been suffering from recurrent bouts of similar symptoms resulting in two prior hospital admissions and one emergency department visit for exacerbations managed with high doses of oxycodone, her clinical picture was complex. Her condition prompted immediate investigative measures including a right upper quadrant ultrasound uncovering gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis but did not fully explain the pain as liver function tests were only slightly elevated from baseline and kidney functions remained within normal ranges, while urine culture isolated pseudomonas.

Given her MS history displaying flaccid paralysis in bilateral lower extremities without any recent exacerbation of this underlying condition was noted alongside stable anemic status on CBC tests with a hematocrit at the low end within normal limits, and chronically elevated transaminases potentially linked to her increased oxycarbazepine dosage as well-known diazepam use.

During your stay, we closely monitored these findings which led us to make several medication adjustments with an increase in oxcarbazepine dose and tapering of the previously elevated opioid therapy via oxycodone transitioning back to oral regimen after IV usage. Depression was also present, for which treatment continued while considering a possible reduction if liver enzyme levels persisted high with concurrent management in our pain service department regarding your intrathecal baclofen pump and forthcoming endoscopy due to GI concerns were scheduled by the respective specialties; hepatitis panels returned negative, thus eliminating concern for viral causes of liver enzyme elevation.

"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo man with history of CHF, atrial fibrillation s/p AV nodal ablation now with pacemaker, hypertension, dementia, and prior h/o mechanical falls admitted s/p fall after 1 episode of nonbloody diarrhea and vomiting yesterday in group-home; found to be afebrile in ED with vital signs wnl and imaging studies showing no acute intracranial process or fractures. INR found to be supratherapeutic at 3.9. # S/p fall. Differential diagnosis includes orthostasis in setting of diarrhea and vomiting and likely hypovolemia versus mechanical fall versus cardiogenic cause(arrhythmia, valvular disease) versus vasovagal event versus CNS event. History seems more consistent with orthostasis or mechanical fall, although episode was unwitnessed. CT head in the ED showed no acute process or bleed. Cardiac enzymes were negative x2 ___ hours apart (CK was slightly elevated likely secondary to muscle tissue breakdown- this was downtrending at time of discharge; troponin was also slightly elevated secondary to CKD and remained stable; CK-MB was normal x2). Orthostatic vitals were negative after IV fluid hydration. Telemetry showed two episodes of NSVT but was otherwise unremarkable. His outpatient cardiologist was contacted by phone and recent TEE report reviewed. This showed globally preserved left ventricular systolic function with no aortic stenosis. Prior to his discharge, patient walked with physical therapy and he was given a walker for use when he returns to the assisted living facility with his wife. His mental status, although initially slightly altered (likely secondary to sleepiness from having been in an ambulance and the emergency room all night), cleared by the second hospital day. It was confirmed with his wife and daughter that he was mentating at baseline prior to his discharge. # Diarrhea. Per assisted living facility report, he had a couple episodes of non-bloody emesis and diarrhea prior to the fall. His hct was normal and stable during this admission. He was given some intravenous hydration in the emergency room and overnight the first night. There was no witness diarrhea or vomiting during the admission. He tolerated POs without complication. # Diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic. Does have mild 1+ pitting edema on left ankle, however no JVP elevation or lung findings to suggest CHF exacerbation given clear chest film and normal exam. Pitting edema of left ankle is chronic per outpatient records. # Interstitial lung disease. Heterogenous appearance of the lungs with interstitial prominence seen on CXR confirms that interstitial lung disease is still an active issue for this pt. We continued his home prednisone dose. # Chronic kidney disease Stage III (eGFR = 43). Stable. No active issues. # Atrial fibrillation, supratherapeutic INR at 3.9. We held his warfarin during this admission and recommended that he have his INR checked on ___ after discharge. Coumadin can be restarted at the discretion of his outpatient providers. # Hypertension. Currently normotensive. We continued his home lisinopril and metoprolol. Lasix was restarted at time of discharge. # Benign prostatic hypertrophy. No active issues. # Dementia. Per daughter, pt's demential was worsening over the past few months. Head CT, as above, was unremarkable for acute process. Per family, his mentation was back to baseline at time of discharge. # FEN. Low-sodium, heart-healthy diet. # Prophylaxis.

Because of recurrent cough and CXR showing new LLL infiltrate different from prior CXR, along with a history of ""aspiration"" and poor adherence with diet, she was treated for aspiration pneumomnia. She actually failed treatment for HCAP recently. During this admission, she was treated for aspiration PNA with a full course of Cefepime and Flagyl. She seemed to improve subjectively but it was difficult to examine her as she frequently refused. Swallow nurses evaluated patient and recommended honey thick liquids and soft solids. She refused video swallow and refused this diet. She initially expressed good insight into her decisision, and her wishes were therefore granted. However, she became more agitated and very paranoid with paranoid delusions (I am working with the FBI, they stole/took my baby) and yelling with profanities. She acted like ""hoarders"" keeping empty and full soda cans, papers, trash, food wastes and other items in her room. She was found to be abusing her medications including nitroglycerine and hiding them from the nurses staff. She called her PCP office several time and was yelling profanities at the office staff, at our nursing staff and at me personally. She became very distruptive to the medical floor and refused examination. She also called ___ several time and code purple was activated on one ocassion. Psychiatry was reconsulted for consideration of psychiatric admission. It was initially difficult to differentiate delirium from acute psychiatric reaction and psychosis, however, it became clear that her agitation and paranoia are from psychiatric reaction. This was ocnfirmed by an EEG which showed no evidence of metabolic or toxic encephalopathy. In addition, repeat CXR and blood tests were all OK.

Of note, during admission, social work and case management worked on getting her into rehabilitation. This was also at the recommendation of her PCP. There were concerns regarding care at home, though she does have a home health aid. However, because of her decompensated psychiatric situation, she requires an inpatient psychiatric admission. The Medical consult team should be available if any of her chronic medical situations decompensate. We had a meeting with her sister who came from ___ regarding plan of care. The meeting was on ___ and took 45 minutes regarding plan of care and prognosis. Her sister is not her HCP (her home aid is her HCP!). In regards to other medical problems: 1-Left Ulnar Collateral Ligament Sprain/Osteophyte Fracture: She was assessed by hand surgery and a cast was placed. However, she demanded it be taken off. The cast was re-adjusted to no avail. She understood the risks of removing the cast. OT was consulted and changed her cast to a fabricated splint with better effect. She needs to be seen in Hand Surgery Clinic in ___ weeks. 2-Chronic systolic CHF: She was not found to be volume overloaded. Her Lasix was initially held given renal failure. She remained euvolemic and her lasix was restarted on ___. 3-Non-Hodgkins lymphoma: She has follow up with Hemetology/Oncology arranged as outpatient. She missed the appointment because of her psychiatric situation. She would need re-appointment once she is discharged to resume care.

During this admission, you underwent treatment for aspiration pneumonia but refused examination due to your refusal regarding medication administration and disclosure about laxative abuse despite expressing initial insight into her situation. Your psychiatric state deteriorated leading to paranoid delusions that resulted in aggressive behavior, including hoarding items around the room which caused disturbance on the medical floor. She required constant supervision due to safety concerns from profanity and yelling towards staff members at multiple times during your stay, even calling her primary care physician office repeatedly with disruptive tones while trying unsuccessfully several times for code purple activations when she attempted ejection by pushing a call button rapidly on the bed. An evaluation led to antipsychotic medication prescriptions and continuous observation due to potential psychiatric admission, despite her physical conditions remaining relatively stable without evidence of metabolic or toxic encephalopathy as per EEG findings, indicating your agitation primarily stemmed from a psychological origin.

"Brief Hospital Course: This ___ yo female was admitted on ___ for chest pain and discharged on ___. 1. Atypical chest pain. Patient presents to the hospital with similar symptoms that brought her into the hospital in ___. During that prior hospital course, she received cardiac catheterization which showed similar CAD as prior catheterization, and no intervention was done. However, this time the chest discomfort is more centrally located. She ruled out for MI with negative cardiac biomarkers x3 and essentially unchanged EKG. She did not tolerate nitroglycerin, and heparin gtt was thought not to be necessary given the atypical nature of her symptoms. She received morphine and home pain medication with minimal alleviation of her symptoms. The nuclear stress test showed no EKG changes and the perfusion study also showed no defect. Her estimated stress LVEF is slightly lower than the prior echo estimation, but this is somewhat expected given the difference in modality. It is likely that her symptoms is related to GI etiology, such as GERD and esophogeal spasm. She was initiated with a H2 blocker. An endoscopy was recommended to patient, and she decided to have this done in the outpatient basis with her primary care physician. Other possible cause could be small vessel disease, which may be augmented with calcium channel blockers or increase Imdur dose, if her HR and BP tolerates.

"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ who presented to ___ at 15 weeks gravid with abdominal pain and MRI abdomen/pelvis concerning for acute perforated appendicitis. The Acute Care Surgery service was consulted and the patient was consented for appendectomy. The patient as also seen by the Obstetric team and fetal heart rate and uterus were checked which were normal. On HD2, the patient was taken to the OR and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with drainage of peritoneal abscess. This procedure went well and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. She was transferred to the surgical floor on IV fluids for hydration, Unasyn, and was made NPO due to the amount of bowel dilation and risk for ileus. The patient received IV acetaminophen PCA morphine for pain control. Foley catheter was removed and the patient voided without issue. Obstetrics did a post-op fetal heart rate check which was normal. Diet was gradually advanced but she had emesis on POD #3. Diet was backed down and then readvanced as tolerated to a regular diet. A bowel regimen was started and the patient had a bowel movement on POD #5. The patient reported right calf pain which she had for the last two days and, although there were no clinical signs of DVT on physical exam, a RLE US was ordered given her risk factors and the US was negative for a DVT. IVF were discontinued, PO oxycodone and acetaminophen were ordered which provided adequate pain relief, augmentin was started which the patient tolerated. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular and pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. She received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient ambulated early and frequently. At the time of discharge, the patient was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, tolerating a regular diet, voiding without issue and pain was well-controlled. Discharge instructions were reviewed with the patient with verbalized understanding.","You were admitted to ___ with abdominal pain and had an abdominal MRI which showed acute, perforated appendicitis. You were taken to the operating room and had your appendix removed laparoscopically. As the inflammation and perforation of your appendix caused dilation of your bowel, you were initially restricted from eating after surgery. You gradually had return of bowel function and are now tolerating a regular diet. Your pain is now better and is controlled with oral pain medication. While in the hospital, you received an intravenous antibiotic called Unasyn (Ampicillin/Sulbactam) to prevent recurrence of infection. This antibiotic was converted to oral Augmentin (Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid) for which you will receive a prescription.","```json

"Brief Hospital Course: Ms ___ is a ___ year-old female with history of multiple sclerosis who presented to the ED with L flank pain and suffered severe anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast with acute hypoxia and hypotension while undergoing CT scan; in this setting she received 1 mg 1:1000 IV epinephrine and developed acute lung injury/pulmonary edema and acute myocardial injury for which she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit as described above. She was subsequently transferred to the medical floor on ___. Once transferred to the medical floor, her supplemental oxygen was progressively weaned off. Despite persistent symptoms of central chest discomfort following her anaphylactoid event, EKG/enzymes failed to demonstrate ongoing/residual cardiac injury. Ms ___ noted post-prandial nausea/vomiting for several days s/p her ICU stay. She was treated with compazine and zofran with minimal relief. With ongoing symptoms, she received a second dose of compazine on ___ approximately four hours later, the patient developed facial contortion and left hand spasm felt likely to represent an acute dystonic reaction to the compazine. She was treated with benadryl, cogentin, and valium. After approximately ___ hours, her left hand spasm resolved, however Ms ___ remained unable to open her jaw from a closed position despite repeated dosing of benadryl, cogentin, and valium. She was seen by the Neurology Consult Service and also by Dr ___ Oral-Maxillofacial ___. Although initially unable to speak because of concurrent inability to move her tongue, after two days her tongue ""loosened"" and she was able to communicate verbally despite persistent jaw closure. It was uncertain whether her inability to open the jaw represented trismus vs alternate complication of her dystonic reaction. Ms ___ was observed during sleep with persistent closed jaw, arguing against conversion disorder. She was maintained on IV fluid hydration and liquid diet by straw. Consideration was given to administration of nerve block to facilitate mechanical manipulation to open the jaw, however on ___ her jaw was released from the closed position after 10 mg IV valium and mechanical manipulation by her mother - once released, Ms ___ was able to independently open/close her jaw, eat, and speak without need for further mechanical intervention. In terms of Ms ___ original complaint of left flank pain, Neurology Consult service felt that this most likely represented a thoracic radiculopathy related to a herniated disc. Her symptoms persisted, in waxing/waning intensity, throughout her hospital course. On ___, Ms ___ notice that her right foot was ""turning in"" (ankle inversion) when she walked; she notes that this is a finding she relates to prior flares of her multiple sclerosis. She also noted ""clumsiness"" of her right hand, most noticeable in her hand-writing which has become less legible, as well as right eye ""blurry vision"". A head MRI was obtained which demonstrated new multiple sclerosis disease activity. Upon consultation with Ms ___ primary neurologist, Dr ___ scheduled ___ dose was postponed and she was treated with a 3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 250mg every 6 hours. Her next scheduled ___ dose was arranged for ___. Repeat echocardiogram ___ demonstrated essentially normal cardiac function, without evidence of pericardial effusion or focal wall motion abnormality.","You were evaluated in the Emergency Department for left-sided flank pain. You had an abdominal CT scan to evaluate this pain, and had a severe allergic ""anaphylactoid"" reaction to the intravenous contrast used for the CT. You were given a high dose of epinephrine, as well as steroids, famotadine, benadryl, and intravenous fluids for treatment of this reaction. The severe allergic reaction and high dose of epinephrine resulted in injury to your heart and lungs. You were admitted and treated for this reaction in the Intensive Care Unit for 2 days, and once stable, transferred to the medicine floor. You also developed a facial contortion and locked jaw (a dystonic reaction) in response to a medication you took for nausea, called Compazine. This resolved initially with medications, except your jaw remained locked for 4 days. You recieved benadryl, benztropine (Cogentin), and Valium. Higher doses of valium in addition to manual manipulation of your jaw was required to finally open the jaw. You developed symptoms of right foot inversion, right hand clumsiness, and right eye ""blurring"". An MRI of your head was consistent with an active multiple sclerosis flare.

"Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o female with H/O seizure disorder, obesity, and significant tobacco abuse presenting with inconsistently localizable chest pain reproducible by palpation with extension to ""whole body."" # Chest Pain: No acute cardiac cause identified. Pain lasted over 24 hours at a reported ___ intensity without EKG changes or biomarker elevation for myonecrosis. Also, pain was reproducible on exam, although her history and exam were quite variable from examiner to examiner. Patient was able to fall asleep despite complaints of ongoing pain. She was unable to perform nuclear stress testing due to inability to lay still on her back, which according to the patient is a chronic problem for her. She was also unable to cooperate with a non-imaging exercise stress test. Since ischemia was unlikely given ongoing chest pain without evidence of infarction, other pharmacological stress testing or imaging modalities were not pursued. An echocardiogram was obtained which was unrevealing for any acute wall motion abnormalities but did note grade I diastolic dysfunction. A GI cocktail and PPI did not improve the pain. She was treated with standing Tylenol and ibuprofen for presumed costochondritis. A subclinical seizure leading to fall was a possibility, but CK's were not elevated and pt could not remember any such episode. Patient also had no evidence for pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection by ___ angiogram. The radiology department there felt the 3.9cm ectasia of the ascending aorta seemed chronic and stable and was very unlikely to be causing any of her symptoms. The plan was to have repeat outpatient CT scan of chest in 6 ___ year to assess stability and size. She eventually became pain free prior to discharge. # Seizure disorder- continued divalproex per outpatient schedule # Depression/anxiety - continued quetiapine, clonazepam, escitalopram, and trazodone. Social work was consulted to ensure adequate community resources were available prior to discharge. # Atypical cells on Differential - After discussion with heme/path, the initial report of 12 atypical lymphoctes was changed to 2 reactive lymphcytes, and an automated differentual the next day was reported as negative for atypicals. Plan was to have repeat surveillance WBC differential performed as an outpatient. # Smoking- Patient was given a nicotine patch and encouraged at smoking cessation. Social work was consulted.","You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain. We made sure you did not have a heart attack by checking EKGs and several blood tests. We also made sure you did not have a blood clot in your lungs by performing a special type of CT scan. We tried to have you perform different types of stress tests but you could not lie flat because of chronic back discomfort. You did have an echocardiogram which did not reveal any acute cardiac pathology. Although we are not certain what the cause of your pain is, it is most likely musculoskeletal given that your whole body hurts, and we could reproduce the pain by examining you. The pain is is not related to your heart, lungs or major blood vessels in your chest. We incidentally found a small widening of your aorta which is not causing your pain, but it should be monitored with another CT scan in 6 months to make sure it is not getting bigger.

"Brief Hospital Course: #Left pleural effusion: Pt. p/w new onset L chest pain in setting of recent hospitalization for new pleural effusion. Cytology from the initial pleural effusion tapped during hospitalization in ___ was positive for malignancy consistent with anaplastic thyroid cancer. Her CXR on admission showed total whiteout of L lung, and a L chest tube was placed in ED by IP on ___. On ___ IP performed an thoracoscopy with lysis of adhesions and biopsy of a pleural mass; biopsy pathology returned positive for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Her chest tube continued to have high output (~1.5 L per day) and she required IVF for one episode of tachycardia to 120s. She was discharged with stable vital signs, and was able to intake sufficient PO fluids daily. Given the concern for hypotension, her home metoprolol was held and not restarted upon discharge. She was scheduled for close outpatient follow-up with her PCP upon discharge. #SIRS: Pt. was admitted with WBC of 22, lactate 7.2, tachycardia and hypotension, concerning for SIRS/sepsis in the setting of a new pleural effusion. However she remained afebrile and her leukocytosis did not improve on vancomycin and meropenem x5 days. Intravenous fluid resuscitation improved both her hypotension and lactate. Furthermore her pleural cultures were negative for growth. Given these results, oncology and the primary medicine team felt that she had a leukomoid reaction to new metastatic spread of anaplastic thyroid cancer and not sepsis. #Hyponatremia: Presented to the ED with Na 127, compared to 132 at discharge. Serum osm ~264. Urine Na was low. Likely hypovolemic in setting of SIRS, with elevated lactate. Her serum Na improved with fluid resuscitation. # Anaplastic thyroid cancer: Cause of pleural effusion given prior cytology and biopsy showing anaplastic cells.

Our interventional pulmonologists placed a chest tube to help drain the effusion. After the tube was placed, your pain improved, and you were able to breathe more comfortably. You also underwent a procedure to biopsy a mass in your pleural space. When you were admitted, your bloodwork showed that your white blood cell count was very high. We started you on two antibiotics, vancomycin and meropenem, to help cover possible bacteria infections. However, you did not have fevers and your blood and pleural fluid cultures did not show any evidence of infection; therefore these antibiotics were stopped.

Further investigation through thoracoscopy and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic to your pleura from prior known ATC. This event led you to experience a leukemoid reaction, which is characterized by elevated WBC count without infection as evidenced by negative cultures despite clinical findings that mimic sepsis. Your electrolytes initially showed hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemia and SIRS-related endogenous capillary leak syndrome, but this improved with IV fluid resuscitation.


Your discharge plan includes not restarting metoprolol at home because of the risks associated with volume depletion from your high pleural output (~1.5 L per day). You have been advised to maintain adesquent oral intake and monitored for hypotension, which could warrant outpatient IV fluid therapy if necessary.

"Brief Hospital Course: Mr ___ was a ___ male with decompensated hepatitis C virus infection and resultant cirrhosis with portal hypertension, ascites and peripheral edema (s/p TIPS) who was awaiting transplant. He presented from ___ for rising Bilirubin in the setting of multiple evolving medical problems. During this hospitalization patient's end stage liver disease continued to decompensate and his course was further complicated by development of hepatorenal syndrome, persistent leukocystosis, and eventually development of sepsis which led to his death. Below is a brief outline of some of the major medical issues that affected his course. #) End Stage Liver Disease: Secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis. Patient had severe decompensation of liver disease over the course of this hospitalization. Encephalopathy worsened likely given an underlying infection of unclear source in spite of being on broad antibiotic coverage for much of his hospitalization. Bilirubin continued to trend up. He underwent MRCP that did not indicate any obstructing stones though he was noted to have a large pancreatic pseudocyst. Course also complicated by the development of hepatorenal syndrome eventually requiring dialysis. By the end of patient's hospitalization MELD score was greater than 40. Patient required a liver transplant, however, transplant was no longer an option when patient's white count began to rise and it was determined by abdominal ultrasound that he was found to have multiple liver lesions that appeared to be abscesses. Patient's family agreed to make him DNR/DNI given his poor prognosis. #) Persistent Leukocytosis: WBC count elevated for most of this admission. He was found to have a blood culture positive for Coagulase Negative Staph on ___ and was treated with a course of Vancomycin. He had many negative urine, stool, peritoneal cultures, and subsequent blood cultures that were negative. Patient was on broad coverage antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem and micafungin for a significant portion of his hospitalization. He was only noted to be febrile sporadically. The infectious disease team, who followed the patient, had a high level of suspicion that the patient's pancreatic pseudocyst could have been infected. Towards the end of the ___ hospital course his white count rose precipitously as high as 48. As explained above, an ultrasound of his liver demonstrated multiple liver lesions that may have been abscesses. #) Hepatorenal Syndrome: Patient course was complicated by the development of hepatorenal syndrome. Creatinine initially responded to albumin and fluids but then began to increase precipitously and it was at this point that octreotide and midodrine were initiated. Hemodialysis was eventually initiated. Patient had been listed for a kidney transplant. #) Bullous disorder of unclear etiology: The patient presented with a bullous skin lesions on the trunk and lower legs felt by dermatology to be most consistent with drug-induced bullous pemphigoid. He was s/p extended stay in the ___ burn unit for treatment of these lesions. Though the patient had an exposure to chloroquine prior to admission the dermatology team did not feel that these lesions were completely consistent with a chloroquine bullous reaction. They also considered lasix as a potential cause. Lesions remained stable with wound care and treatment with clobetasol. Patient did have a re-exposure to lasix on ___ and subsequently developed a morbiliform drug hypersensitivity reaction on the skin with no worsening of the bullous eruption. This new eruption was mainly managed with medication for pruritus.","was admitted for management of his end stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C. During this admission he was also evaluated for bullous skin lesions felt to be secondary to chloroquine ingestion. His hospitalization was also complicated by possible development of hepatorenal syndrome. He was being considered for liver transplantation until he began to develop sepsis. Cultures including blood, stool and urine remained negative though patient had a known pseudocyst that may have ultimately been the source of infection. Prior to his death patient became hypotensive and was noted to have diffuse cystic lesions throughout his liver that were likely abscesses. Given his critical condition his family decided to make make DNR/DNI though antibiotics were continued. Patient was pronounced dead on ___ at 7;40am.","```json

Your diabetes was controlled by adjusting your insulin glargine regimen based on fasting blood glucose levels that were kept well under 200 mg/dL during the hospital stay without requiring additional insulin administration, and an HbA1c of 6.7% reflected this control level over time. Furthermore, you continue to manage Crohn's disease with sulfasalazine and ciprofloxacin while also taking omeprazole for peptic ulcer disease prevention. Although alcoholic cirrhosis is noted in your medical history without evidence of decompensation from the last endoscopy, chronic pancreatitis remains managed with creon supplements and you are encouraged to adhere strictly to a 2L fluid restriction due to hyponatremia risk. Follow-up appointments will include cardiology for further assessment of heart failure management efficacy as well as chemistry panels to monitor electrolyte balance, specifically the scheduled Chem 7 test during your next visit.","['Hyponatremia', 'Hyperkalemia', 'Chest pain/Hypertension management']","['Normalization of hyponatremia with fluid restriction', 'Major medication regimen adjustments (e.g., carvedilol, irbesartan, imdur)', 'Thorough cardiac workup for chest pain']","['Follow up with Cardiology', 'Repeat Chem 7 at next appointment', 'Adhere to 2L fluid restriction']",3,3,3

The patient was kept on sevelamer, Ergocalciferol, nephrocaps, and on low K/Phos/Na diet. # Pancytopenia: unclear cause at this point. The pt's platelets on admission were 67. Possible cause may include chronic hepatitis C infection leading to cirrhosis. Cirhosis leads to low Plt count through the loss of TPO production. His anemia is likely due to CKD. Another possible explanation of his pancytopenia might be splenic sequestration secondary to splenomegaly as a result from HCV cirrhosis. The cause of the pancytopenia was unclear at the time of discharge and further investigation of this problem was deferred to the outpatient care provider. # Hepatitis C infection: per patient, is a chronic issue. The patient had history of encephalopathy as documented in the chart. He is not currently on HCV treatment. Given the history of encephalopathy complicating his HCV infection, HCV treatment is highly recommended. Further discussion regarding HCV treatment with the patient deferred to the outpatient care provider. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - The patient is noted to have pancytopenia since ___. However, the cause of this is still unknown. Would defer for the PCP for further investigation. - The patient has HCV infection with history of encephalopathy. If the encephalopathy was due to HCV infection, it would be a strong indication for starting HCV treatment. - The patient has had a thrombectomy as treatment of thrombosed HD graft on the left side. Would recommend regular graft check and care. The graft should undergo regular maintenance every 3 months. - Please remove purse-string sutures on ___.","During your admission your underwent thrombectomy for removal of the clot .

Patient describes nonbloody, occasionally bilious vomiting in the setting of esophageal ""burning"" and marked leukocytosis. MRI of his aorta showed stable AAA and stable dissection without evidence of any other intra-abdominal processes. Labs showed stable hct at 51, troponin < .01, and lipase WNL. The most likely etiology was thought to be a viral gastroenteritis given headaches, chills, and diarrhea, but given history of improvement with warm baths, this could also represent cannibis emesis syndrome. He was managed with zofran and given maintenance IV fluids on the floor, with improvement in his symptoms and tolerating POs at the time of his discharge. # ___. At presentation, his Cre was 2.6 (from a baseline of 0.7-1.0). This was most likely pre-renal given his recent repeated emesis and poor PO intake. MRI aorta showing widely perfused renal arteries bilaterally. He was given lactated ringers and clears as tolerated. At the time of discharge, his cre was 0.9 and he denied lightheadedness, dizziness, or thirst with stable vitals. # Leukocytosis. He had an elevated WBC of 18 from baseline 9 on presentation with no associated fever. This was thought to represent enteritis, but could also be an inflammatory response from his recent vomiting. Of note, there was no evidence of other infectious etiologies (CXR WNL, no dysuria, UA WNL). # Hypokalemia. His K was 3.0 on admission, likely low in the setting of emesis and poor PO intake. T wave inversions in V4-V6 on EKG are similar to his previous presentations of nausea/vomiting and hypokalemia. Given persistent hypokalemia and hypertension in the setting of known bilateral adrenal nodules, this may also represent Conn's syndrome vs. renal hypoperfusion from his dissection (limited perfusion through his renal artery pseudolumen). His hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and spironolactone were held during admission, and his potassium was repleted (40 mEq PO, 40 mEq IV) to 4.3 at the time of discharge, with further workup for Conn's syndrome recommended in the outpatient setting.

Persistent hypokalemia in the setting of aggressive potassium repletion with coconut water, hypertension, and adrenal nodules on imaging is concerning for Conn's syndrome. Urinalysis, renin, and aldosterone were unable to be obtained due to patient's strong preference for outpatient workup. If this cannot be performed, transition of diuretics from hydrochlorothiazide to aldactone is recommended.

Despite the nonbloody nature of your vomitus being occasionally bilious, this was not immediately suggestive of gastrointestigeral bleeding or malignancy considering you are young for such a condition without prior history suggesting these etiologies. Your white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels were elevated at presentation due to suspected enteritis-like illness with possible dehydration from repeated emesis, but no evidence of infection or renal dysfunction was found on further testing. An MRI revealed a stable aneurysm without acute changes which might explain your chest discomfort and hypokalemia potentially linked to previous vomiting episodes; however, the presence of adrenal nodules raises concern for Conn's syndrome that could also contribute to electrolyte imbalances. Hypertension was managed with medication adjustments during stay but remains a consideration in your ongoing care due to possible concurrent renal hypoperfusion from dissection and chronic hypertension being risk factors of both AAA and aneurysmal rupture/dissection itself, respectively.
